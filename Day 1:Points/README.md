# Day 1 — Points (Tanzania Health Facilities)

For Day 1 of the #30DayMapChallenge, I created an interactive web map showing the distribution of health facilities across Tanzania.

The visualization includes:

- **individual point locations** of hospitals  
- a **heatmap** to highlight areas with high concentration of facilities  
- **district names + boundaries** for geographic context

### Why this matters  
Mapping facility points helps reveal geographic patterns: some regions have dense clusters of health services, while others appear underserved.

### Output  
I generated an **interactive HTML web map** (video demo shared on my socials).

### Data Sources  
- Hospital locations: [HOTOSM Tanzania Health Facilities](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/hotosm_tza_health_facilities) (Humanitarian Data Exchange)  
- Administrative boundaries: [Tanzania Subnational Administrative Boundaries (levels 0-3)](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/cod-ab-tza) (Humanitarian Data Exchange)
