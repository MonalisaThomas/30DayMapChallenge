# Day 1 — Points (Tanzania Health Facilities)

For Day 1 of the #30DayMapChallenge, I created an interactive web map showing the distribution of health facilities across Tanzania.

The visualization includes:

- **individual point locations** of hospitals
- a **heatmap** to highlight areas with high concentration of facilities
- **district names + boundaries** for geographic context

### Why this matters
Mapping facility points helps reveal geographic patterns:
Some regions have dense clusters of health services, while others appear underserved.

### Output
I generated an **interactive HTML web map** (video demo shared on my socials).

### Data Sources
- Hospital locations: open data (health facility dataset – Tanzania)
- Administrative Boundaries: HDX (Humanitarian Data Exchange)
