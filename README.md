# 30 Day Map Challenge 2025 — Monalisa Mbilinyi

This repository documents my participation in the global **#30DayMapChallenge**, a community challenge where we create a map based on a theme every day in November.

My focus will be on African geographies and exploring different visual storytelling styles.

---

## Goals

- build consistency in mapping practice  
- create a public portfolio of spatial work  
- learn through doing + explore new map styles  
- share maps and insights openly every day

---

## Repository Structure

Each day has its own folder


Each day folder contains:

- dataset(s)
- code scripts / notebooks
- exported map (html / png / video)
- a small README describing the map

---

## Tech + Approach

This project is flexible.  
Different days will use different libraries + techniques depending on the theme.

I will focus on:

- python geospatial (geopandas, folium, contextily, etc)
- open data sources
- communicating spatial patterns in Africa
- Any tools I will find helpful

---

## Sharing

I will share selected maps on:

- **LinkedIn** — professional posts
- **Instagram** — visuals + reels


---

## Licensing

This repository is public.  
All external datasets will be cited and credited in each day's folder.
